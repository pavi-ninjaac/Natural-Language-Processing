Start with the basics of text preprocessing:

Tokenization
Stemming
Lemmatization
POS
NER
Bag of words
Tf-idf
Word2vec
Word embeddings
Then implement basic Project like sentiment analysis.

Models :

RNN
Bi-RNN
LSTM
AFTER ALL THESE LEARN SOME ADVANCED MODELS

Seq2seq
Encoders and decoders
Transfer learning models ( BERT)
Main important thing is practice regularly on these concepts to make your base strong.
